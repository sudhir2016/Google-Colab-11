Tomato plant disease detector. 
The steps are as follows.

- Load TensorFlow, Keras and Python libraries.
- Load the Plant Village Dataset.
- Create small dataset of 50 images of tomato, 5 of each category for testing.
- Load the VGG16 network.
- Add a head layer to the model to train on to tomato plant disease detection.
- Train the model on training data.
- Evaluate the model on test data.
- Use the model for predictions.
- Verify predictions.
